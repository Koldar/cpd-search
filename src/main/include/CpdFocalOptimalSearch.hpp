     * @brief CPD Focal search Optimal
     * 
     * 
     * Like CPD Focal Search (::CPDFocalSearch) but with he gimmicky that when we find a solution we keep going up until 
     * we reach the optimal solution. This algorithm is optimal. To make the bounded suboptimal algorithm CpdFocalSearch optimal
     * we need to keep going until the upperbound equals to lowerbound.
     * 
     * As soon as a solution is found, the upperbound is set to its cost.
     * 
     * 
     * IMportant notes
     * ===============
     * 
     * @li when we revise the upperbound in the successors of a state we don't save the successors that has revised the upperbound last, since such successor it not necessary the next element popped from focal list: in this step we don't compute a new goal. Hence for this very reason, goal->getG() != upperbound (albeit at the ne dof the algorithm we have that goal->getG() == upperbound)
     * @li when we early terminate or wyhen we get a new goal, we check first if the new path is actually shorter than the previous one. this because this search is NOT a bestFirst search, so it is possible to obtain worse solution temporary;
     * @li the heuristic is consisent, but the search is not a bestFirst search, so items in the closed list can be put in open again if new_g < old_g;
     * @li if the upperbound is less than the lowerbound and no solutions have been found, the search has no solutions.
